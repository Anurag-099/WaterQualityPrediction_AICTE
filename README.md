# 🧪 Water Quality Prediction using Machine Learning

Hi! 👋 This is a mini-project I worked on as part of the **AICTE Virtual Internship (June 2025)**, sponsored by **Shell** and supported by **Edunet Foundation**. The aim was to predict different **water quality parameters** using **machine learning techniques**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Water pollution is a serious environmental concern. Predicting chemical parameters in water can help in early detection of pollution and ensure access to clean water.  
This project explores a **multi-output machine learning regression approach** to predict various **water quality indicators** simultaneously.

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python 3.12**
- **Pandas, NumPy** – Data handling and manipulation  
- **Scikit-learn** – Machine learning model implementation  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** – Data visualization  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive development environment  

---

## 📊 Key Project Steps

- Worked with real-world **water quality datasets**
- Cleaned and **preprocessed** the data for missing/null values and scaling
- Built a **MultiOutputRegressor** using **RandomForestRegressor** as the base estimator
- Evaluated the model performance using:
  - ✅ **R² Score**
  - ✅ **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- Visualized important relationships between chemical parameters

---

## 🔍 What the Model Predicts

The model is trained to predict the following **water quality parameters**:

- **NH₄** (Ammonium)  
- **BOD5** (Biochemical Oxygen Demand)  
- **Colloids**  
- **O₂** (Dissolved Oxygen)  
- **NO₃**, **NO₂** (Nitrate, Nitrite)  
- **SO₄**, **PO₄** (Sulfate, Phosphate)  
- **Cl** (Chloride)
